## Action details


### Action 1 - Start session {#Action-1}

| Action | Action Timeline (Seconds) | Playhead Position (Seconds) | Client Request |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| Auto-play or Play button pressed, video starts loading.  | 0 | 0 | `/api/v1/sessions`  |

**Implementation details**

This call signals _the intention of the user to play_ a video. It returns a Session ID ( `{sid}` ) to the client that is used to identify all subsequent tracking calls within the session. The player state is not yet "playing", but is instead "starting".  [Mandatory session parameters](/help/media-collection-api/mc-api-ref/mc-api-sessions-req.md) must be included in the `params` map in the request body.  On the backend, this call generates an Adobe Analytics initiate call.

**Sample request body**

```
{
    playerTime: {
        playhead: 0,
        ts: <timestamp>
    },
    eventType:sessionStart, params: {
        "media.playerName": "sample-html5-api-player",

```


>[!NOTE]
>
>**No Seek Events? -** There is no explicit support in the Media Collection API for `seekStart` or `seekComplete` events. This is because certain players generate a very large number of such events when the end-user is scrubbing, and several hundred users could easily bottleneck the network bandwidth of a backend service. Adobe works around explicit support for seek events by computing heartbeat duration based on device timestamp, rather than playhead position.
